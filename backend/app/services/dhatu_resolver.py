"""Resolve the verbal root (dhātu) behind any Sanskrit word.

The ensemble engines give a *lemma* — for a verb that is already the root
(gacchati -> gam), but for a derived nominal it is only the stem (yoga, not
yuj). This module recovers the root for derived nominals too, which is the
educationally interesting fact ("yoga comes from √yuj, 'to yoke'").

Source of truth is vidyut's Kośa: its entries for derived stems are
``Kṛdanta`` pratipādikas that carry the originating ``DhatuEntry`` — the
root's aupadeśika form, its prefixes, gaṇa, and Sanskrit gloss (artha).
The raw aupadeśika still carries Pāṇinian it-markers (yu\\ja~ , ru\\Di~^r),
so we clean it via sanskrit_model's ``strip_anubandhas`` and prefer the
294-entry hand-curated ``core_root`` table when the root is in it
("neural/statistical proposes, Pāṇini disposes").

Two things the Kośa does not do for us:

* It files most upasarga-prefixed stems as *Basic* pratipādikas with no
  dhātu link at all, even where the bare derivative beside them is a
  Kṛdanta that has one (anuśāsana: Basic; śāsana: Kṛdanta -> √śās). So a
  canonical prefix gets peeled and the remainder resolved.
* Where a stem has several readings it gives no ranking, and taking the
  first yielded confident nonsense (vidyā from vi+√dā 'give'). So the
  readings are scored — see ``_best_candidate``. Callers that can reach the
  dictionary should pass ``preferred_root``: MW's own etymology outranks
  every heuristic here.

Everything is best-effort: if the vidyut data bundle or sanskrit_model
checkout is absent, resolve() simply returns None and the caller keeps its
prior behaviour.
